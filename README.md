## 📝 Task: Interactive To-Do List

### Objective
I built a simple **interactive to-do list** that lets you mark tasks as completed or incomplete just by clicking on them — no refresh needed.

### ✅ What I Implemented
1. **Heading**  
   - Used `<h1>` with the text **"Interactive To Do List"**.
2. **List**  
   - Created a `<ul>` containing my to-do items.
3. **Default Styling**  
   - All tasks start with a default gray text color.  
   - Each task has a tick/check icon on the right, hidden by default.
4. **Interactivity**  
   - Clicking a task changes its color to green and makes the tick icon visible.  
   - Clicking again toggles it back to the incomplete state.
5. **JavaScript Logic**  
   - Used `.classList.toggle()` to switch between completed and incomplete states dynamically.
